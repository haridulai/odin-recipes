      <li>cup sliced carrots</li>
      <li>cup frozen green peas</li>
      <li>cup sliced celery</li>
      <li>cup butter</li>
      <li>cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>teaspoon celery seed</li>
      <li>cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>cup milk</li>
      <li>(9 inch) unbaked pie crusts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)</li>
      <li>
        Combine chicken, carrots, peas, and celery in a saucepan; add water to
        cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes, then remove from the
        heat and drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over
        medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7
        minutes. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed. Slowly stir in
        chicken broth and milk. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until
        thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken and vegetables in the bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid
        mixture over top. Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away any
        excess dough. Make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam
        to escape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is
        bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
