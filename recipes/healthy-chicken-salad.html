    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This healthy chicken salad recipe is made with a mixture of Greek yogurt
      and cottage cheese instead of regular mayonnaise, resulting in a healthier
      version that's still creamy and delicious but higher in protein. Apples
      and dried cranberries add a sweet-tart flavor, while chopped pecans
      provide textural interest in every bite. Serve it on crackers, on a
      croissant, in a pita, or grab a fork and just dig in!
